## i3 config

Thanks to [@alexbooker](https://github.com/alexbooker) [amazing screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcQsDUZiK1GWDcP7BpVO_kw) on configuring i3, an amazing tiling window manager for unix.

I just wish I could use this setup on Windows and OSx as well.

**Handy fuzzy finders**

### Windows 10 note

Windows 10 became a very capable environment for development. Powershell greatly improved,
the upcomming Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (available in Windows Insider Program, fast ring),
and tools like scoop, cconf etc (still miss my stow tho :p)

Windows has a nice tiling feature built in:

- Hit `Win+{Left,Right}` - will tile the window, always at 50% width. If you have other opened applications on this desktop / screen, windows will ask for a second window to fill the string.
- Hit `Win+{Up,Down}` - Same, except that tiling horizontally is working fine but lacks a bit (like filing the screen automatically)
- Hit twice Left or Right to move to second monitor.
- Hit UP twice will fullscreen
- Hit Down twice will minimize
- Hit Left then Right will set the window to its original state
- etc. will complete a bit more later on

### OSx

I have yet to try the latest version (Captain?), and see how tiling works.
