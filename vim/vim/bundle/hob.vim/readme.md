hob.vim
=======

**Hob is like Hub, except that it has an `o` in the middle of it**

Install
-------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/mklabs/vim-hob.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help hob`


Commands
--------

each of these.

Configuration
-------------

If your plugin has some kind of configuration. Detail this here.
