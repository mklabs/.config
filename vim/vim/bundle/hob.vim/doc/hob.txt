*hob.txt*

It's like Hub, but with a "o"~


|hob-intro|	              Introduction
|hob-Installation|	      Installation
|hob-commands|	              Commands


Introduction	                                    *hob* *hob-intro*

Blah, Blah, Blah.

Installation	                                   *hob-installation*

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

>
	cd ~/.vim/bundle
	git clone git://github.com/mklabs/vim-hob.git
<

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with `:help hob`.


Commands	                                            *hob-commands*

Blah, Blah, Blah.
